# MULTITHREADING
## NAME: CHIRAG
## GROUP: 3COE12
## ROLL NO.: 102103335

## Streamlined Methodology:
1.Matrix Multiplication Core: Employs np.dot() for efficient matrix product computation.
<br><br/>
2.Threaded Multiplication: Utilizes 1 to 10 threads for matrix multiplication, managing their execution.
<br><br/>
3.Execution Protocol: Performs multiplication operations with varied thread counts and records durations; presents results in tabular format and plots thread counts against durations.

### OBSERVATIONS: 
  The minimum time taken is for 6 threads.
